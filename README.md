# waybox

Waybox is a Wayland Compositor based on [wlroots](https://github.com/swaywm/wlroots) written in Rust, similar to fluxbox and Openbox from the X-Window system.

This is a project to learn new stuff, do not expect this software to be useful at this point in time. In particular I want to become fluent in Rust and learn about Wayland.
