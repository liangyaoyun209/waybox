# waybox

Waybox is a Wayland Compositor based on [smithay](https://github.com/Smithay/smithay) written in Rust. It will be similar to fluxbox and openbox from the X-Window system. It will have floating windows, with some ambitions toward tiling.

The main goal is to learn new stuff and to provide feedback to the smithay project. Do not expect this software to be useful at this point in time!
